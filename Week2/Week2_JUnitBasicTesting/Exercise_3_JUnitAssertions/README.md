# JUnitAssertions

This is a simple implementation demonstrating how to use **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)** assertions in a Java Maven project.

## Features
- Shows how to integrate **JUnit 5.10.0** using `pom.xml` in a Maven project.
- Includes a test class called `AssertionsTest` that demonstrates the use of various assertion methods.
- Assertion types demonstrated:
  - `assertEquals` – Verifies equality
  - `assertTrue` – Verifies a condition is true
  - `assertFalse` – Verifies a condition is false
  - `assertNull` – Verifies an object is null
  - `assertNotNull` – Verifies an object is not null

## Usage
Compile and run `AssertionsTest.java` using either IntelliJ's test runner or via terminal with Maven:

```bash
mvn test
