# SortingCustomerOrders

This exercise demonstrates sorting customer orders by their total price using **Bubble Sort** and **Quick Sort** algorithm.


## Features
- Order contain `orderId`, `customerName` and `totalPrice`
- Sorts using two algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort(simple, works for slow datasets but extremely slow for large and medium sized datasets)
  - Quick Sort(fast,preferred in real-word based on divide conquer strategy)
- Includes a test class `TestSorting` to display sorted orders using both ` Bubble Sort` and `Quick Sort`


## Usage
Compile and run `TestSorting` to test both sorting methods.
Output contains original order and sorted orders using both algorithm.

## Time Complexity

- Bubble Sort
    - Best Case O(n)
    - Average Case O(n^2)
    - Worst Case O(n^2)
- Quick Sort
    - Best Case O(n log n)
    - Average Case O(n log n)
    - Worst Case O(n^2)
